# 🔑 SSH KEY SETUP FOR GITHUB

**Status**: SSH key generated, awaiting GitHub configuration

---

## 📋 Your SSH Public Key

Your SSH public key has been generated. You need to add it to GitHub:

### **Step 1: Copy Your Public Key**

Run this command to see your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub
```

The output looks like:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx jainampatel1673@gmail.com
```

**Copy the entire line** (starts with `ssh-ed25519` and ends with your email).

## 🔧 Step 2: Add SSH Key to GitHub

### **Option A: Via Web Browser** (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub SSH Settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
   - Or: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

2. **Add the key**:
   - **Title**: `AutoML Development` (or any name)
   - **Key type**: `Authentication Key`
   - **Key**: Paste your public key from above
   - Click **"Add SSH key"**

3. **Confirm**:
   - Enter your GitHub password if prompted
   - You should see a success message

### **Option B: Via GitHub CLI** (If installed)

```bash
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub --title "AutoML Development"
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Test SSH Connection

After adding the key to GitHub, test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Expected output:
```
Hi Jainam1673! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you see this message, you're ready to push! ✅

## 🚀 Step 4: Push to GitHub

Once SSH is working:

```bash
cd /home/jainam/Projects/AutoML

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push all changes
git push -u origin main

# Check status
git status
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"
**Solution**: Make sure you added the public key to GitHub correctly. The key must be copied exactly, including the `ssh-ed25519` prefix and email suffix.

### Issue: "Could not read from remote repository"
**Solution**: 
1. Check the key is added: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Test connection: `ssh -T git@github.com`
3. Verify remote URL: `git remote -v` (should show `git@github.com:Jainam1673/AutoML.git`)

### Issue: "Host key verification failed"
**Solution**: Accept GitHub's fingerprint when prompted:
```bash
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
